v1.0.3 (13 Apr 2013)
--------------------
* Allow the same interactive widget to persist through multiple rounds of reader answers so that the reader does not lose previous work. (The widget still disappears when the reader moves to a state that uses a different interactive widget.)
* Add markers for previous reader answers to the interactive map widget, as an example of the previous point.
* Add an admin handler that allows an admin to reload the default explorations.
* In the statistics dashboard, show detailed exploration statistics for every rule (not just the default one).
* Start a migration to typed objects with their own normalizers and view/edit templates. Remove the old normalizers.
* Bug fixes and general tidying up.
* Security fixes.

v1.0.2 (6 Apr 2013)
-------------------
* Add an interactive map widget, a classifier for 2D coordinates, and a simple exploration showcasing these.
* Show exploration statistics directly in the state editor, so that it is easy to view and act on readers' answers for individual states. 
* Add an 'unresolved answers' list which keeps track of answers that need to be acted on.
* Add a warning to the editor UI when there are self-loops that do not give the reader any feedback.
* Add more unit tests for the Exploration model.
* Add the Python 2.7 backport of unittest.mock for testing.
* Various UI fixes.

v1.0.1 (29 Mar 2013)
--------------------
* Add hits-per-state data to the statistics page.
* Add responsive CSS support for viewing Oppia in mobile devices.
* Add a 'Give Feedback' handler. The feedback is stored in the datastore.
* Improve the display of the main page, the gallery page and the editor pages by tweaking the CSS.
* After an interaction with the reader on the exploration page, scroll down to show the new content.
* Remove the AugmentedUser class, replacing it instead with datastore queries.
* Update sample explorations
* Security fixes

v1.0 (22 Mar 2013)
