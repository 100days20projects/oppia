Answer is equal to {{x | IsNumber}}:
  classifier: Equals(x)

Answer is less than {{x | IsReal}}:
  classifier: IsLessThan(x)

Answer is greater than {{x | IsReal}}:
  classifier: IsGreaterThan(x)

Answer is less than or equal to {{x | IsReal}}:
  classifier: IsLessThanOrEqualTo(x)

Answer is greater than or equal to {{x | IsReal}}:
  classifier: IsGreaterThanOrEqualTo(x)

Answer is between {{a | IsReal}} and {{b | IsReal}}, inclusive:
  classifier: IsInclusivelyBetween(a, b)
  checks:
