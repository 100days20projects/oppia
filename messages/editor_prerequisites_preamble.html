<b>Licensing</b>

<br><br>

In order to maximize the reach and positive impact of the explorations hosted
here, we would like to make it easy to copy and redistribute them. In addition,
we hope that, in the long term, the explorations on this site will be
collectively owned by the Oppia community, so that anyone would feel welcome to contribute to them.

<br><br>

Therefore, all explorations on this site, and contributions to them, are deemed
to be licensed under
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY-SA v4.0</a>,
with a waiver of the attribution (BY) requirement. This allows the content of
explorations can be freely copied, reused, remixed and redistributed. The main
condition is that if someone remixes, transforms or builds upon the material,
they must also distribute their work under the same free license.

<br><br>

The attribution waiver means that, if someone reuses this work, they are not
required to attribute the authors. However, all of your individual
contributions to explorations will be available in the public change logs for
each exploration, and users are encouraged (but not required) to include a link
to the exploration's page on this site.

If you aren't happy with this, please do not continue past this page!
