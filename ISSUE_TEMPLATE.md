If you'd like to propose a new feature, please describe what you'd like to see. Mock ups would be great!

If you're reporting a bug, please be sure to include the expected behaviour, the observed behaviour, and steps to reproduce the problem. Console copy-pastes and any background on the environment would also be helpful.

Thanks!
