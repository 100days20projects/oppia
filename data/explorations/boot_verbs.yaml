boot verb:
  content:
  - type: text
    value: "Boot verbs can also be called stem-changing verbs.<br>\nWhat is it that\
      \ makes it a boot verb? Well... if you use the normal way of writing out verb\
      \ conjugations it looks like this:<br><pre>\nyo                          nosotros<br>\n\
      t\xFA                          vosotros<br>\n\xE9l/ella/usted              \
      \ ustedes<br>\n</pre>\n<br>\nAnd in a boot verb the stem changes only in the\
      \ yo, t\xFA, \xE9l/ella/usted and ustedes forms. And if you draw a line around\
      \ those, it looks like a boot.<br>\n<br>\nIn the case of jugar, since it is\
      \ a verb ending in -gar, it uses the u > ue stem, so what does the stem become?"
