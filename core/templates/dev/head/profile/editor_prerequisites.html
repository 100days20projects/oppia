        <p>
          Welcome to the Oppia editor community! Before you start editing, we'd like to draw your attention to a couple of things.
        </p>

        <h4>Licensing</h4>

        <p>
          In order to maximize the reach and positive impact of the explorations hosted
          here, we would like to make it easy to copy and redistribute them. In addition,
          we expect that all explorations on this site will eventually be
          collectively owned by the Oppia community, so that they can be freely improved
          by others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, all explorations on this site, and contributions to them, are deemed
          to be licensed under
          <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY-SA v4.0</a>,
          with a waiver of the attribution (BY) requirement. This allows the content of
          explorations can be freely copied, reused, remixed and redistributed. The main
          condition is that if someone remixes, transforms or builds upon the material,
          they must also distribute their work under the same free license.
        </p>

        <p>
          The attribution waiver means that, if someone reuses this work, they are not
          required to attribute the authors. However, all of your individual
          contributions to explorations will be available on this site in the exploration
          change log, and people who reuse the exploration are encouraged (but not
          required) to include a link to this page.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you aren't happy with this, please do not continue past this page!
        </p>

        <h4>Community</h4>

        <p>
          This site exists to foster the creation and continual improvement
          of a set of high-quality learning explorations that are freely
          available to everyone. We hope you won't mind taking a little time
          out to read our <a href="/about" target="_blank">About page</a>,
          which, among other things, explains how you can contribute to the site,
          as well as some basic do's and don'ts.
        </p>
