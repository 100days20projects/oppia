          In the long term, we would like all explorations on this site to
          be collectively owned by the Oppia community, so that everyone
          (students as well as teachers!) would feel welcome to contribute to,
          reuse and redistribute them. Therefore, all explorations on this
          site, and contributions to them, are deemed to be licensed under
          the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/" target="_blank">CC0 license</a>. This means that you waive all rights to
          contributions made to the site, thus effectively
          placing the work in the public domain. The intent here is to
          maximize the reach and positive impact of the explorations hosted on
          the site, since anyone would then be able to use them to help others
          learn, copy and redistribute them without needing to ask permission
          or satisfy any conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please note that contributions you make to an exploration will still
          be displayed in the commit logs for each exploration, though the CC0
          license doesn't require attribution by others.
        </p>

          If you aren't happy with this, please do not continue past this page!
