        Welcome to the Oppia Tutorial! We will help you get started with your
        first exploration. First, we'll go over basic definitions and best
        practices. Then we'll end by making a small exploration.
      </p>

      <h3>Exploration Editor</h3>

      <p>
        The first thing you see when you click on "Create an Exploration," and fill out the
        initial information, is the following page, the Exploration Editor.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/emptyExploration0.png">
      <p>
        Oppia will start you off with a State called First State. States are important because
        they are the building blocks for your explorations. Oppia is based on States.
        You can think of States as the places a learner (anybody who views your
        exploration) can potentially reach. All of your States are visible in the
        Exploration Overview (also in the picture). The interface will only show
        one state at a time, and you can navigate to your other States by clicking
        on them in the Exploration Overview box.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="state-components"></a>
      <h3>Components of a State</h3>

      <p>
        Simply put, a State is just some text along with a question (interaction)
        and some rules that can take the learner to another State depending on
        their answer. These are the technical terms and definitions:
      </p>
      <h4><b>Content</b></h4>
      <p>
        The editable block of text you see in the picture. Write whatever you want the learner
        to read.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/content.png">
      <h4><b>Interaction</b></h4>
      <p>
        This could be a text field or any kind of input field, even a map. A learner will
        interact with these elements by putting in some text or placing
        a marker on a map.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/interaction.png">
      <h4><b>Rule</b></h4>
      <p>
        Once an interaction is chosen, you can choose what happens according to what a learner
        inputs. From here, you can provide feedback and then have the learner
        redo the interaction or move them to a different state.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note</b> Rules are where you can specify a new state for the
        learner to go to. You can't do it from the Content on the Interaction.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/rule.png">

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="typical-use"></a>
      <h3><b>Typical Use Case</b></h3>
      <p>
        You will start off with a State. After you add some content, you can add an interaction,
        and then add one or more rules. When you create a Rule you will specify
        the destination, which will either be the current state (if you want the
        learner to redo the interaction) or a new state (if you want to move the
        learner forward). Read on to see a concrete example.
      </p>
      <p><b>What should an exploration be about? </b>
      </p>
      <p>

        Typically, it will revolve around a question. Usually, the more specific, the better.
        A few examples are:

        <ul>
          <li>
            What is the slope of a line?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are the nutritional benefits of a banana?
          </li>
          <li>
            What is the difference between Python and C#?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note</b> The exploration does <em>not</em> need to go in depth or cover
        all the aspects of what you are trying to teach. The goal is to make something
        basic, and then expand on it once learners start using the exploration
        (because you'll have access to their answers and can use that to add more
        content/interactions/rules).
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="sample-exploration"></a>
      <h3><b>Sample Exploration</b></h3>
      <p>
        Ok, now let's write a small exploration to help the learner understand the slope
        of a line.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll create a total of 3 States for the learner to go through in a linear fashion.
        The user will start at the First State, answer a question to go to the
        Second State, and then answer another question to go to the Third State.
        Along the way, we'll add a couple rules.
      </p>

      <h4><b>First State</b></h4>
      <p>
        Let's begin by writing our introduction and asking the learner a question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on the box under "First State" that you saw when the Exploration Editor first
        opened. That's the Content box. Type in the following:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1InitialContent.png">
      <p>
        Notice that after saving, you have access to an interaction. Let's add a number input
        interaction so the learner could input their answer to our question.
      </p>
      <p>Click on Add Interaction.</p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1AddInteraction.png">
      <p>This is what you should see. Go ahead and click on Number Input</p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1NumberInput.png">
      <p>Click Save Interaction. The green box represents what the learner will see. They
        will be able to type their answer here.</p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1AfterNumberInput.png">
      <p>
        Notice that a Rule component is now available. Now we can choose what happens if
        the user types in "2" or "3" or any number. To keep it simple, let's take the user
        to the next state regardless of what they inputed. The following shows how to do
        just that.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1Rule.png">
      <p>
        Now this is important, the Destination section is where you will take the user next.
        By default, it will point back to the current State, which means the user will
        be prompted by the interaction again (but he won't see the content again, since
        he can just scroll up to see it). Let's set the Destination to a new State and
        call it "Method 2".
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1DestinationState.png">
      <p>
        Click Add State, and then Add New Rule and you should see
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1End.png">
      <p>
        We're done with this state. The learner will proceed to the State "Method 2", so
        let's go there and teach the second method. We can do that by clicking on "Method
        2" in the Destination link or in the Exploration Overview window. Once you do that,
        you'll be taken to Method 2.
      </p>

      <h4><b>Second State</b></h4>
      <p>
        Now we're in the second State, method 2. This looks just like what you started the
        exploration with, exept the title is different and the Exploration Overview shows
        two states.
      </p>
      <p>Add the following text:</p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state2Content.png">
      <p>
        Add a Number Input Interaction just like in the First State.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's add two rules for the interaction, one if the learner types in an incorrect
        answer, and one if the answer is correct. Click on Add Rule and make sure it looks
        like the following:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state2Rule1.png">
      <p>
        Notice that I didn't change the Destination, which means that if the learner input
        falls into this category, the learner will see the feedback and then the
        interaction again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click Add Rule again and this time change the rule to "Answer is equal to". Type
        in 1, then add the following feedback and create a new Destination called "Last
        State". It should look like this:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state2Rule2.png">
      <p>
        After clicking "Add New Rule", we are done with this state, so let's move to the
        "Last State" and conclude the exploration (or as an exercise you can explain the
        third slope method).
      </p>

      <h4><b>Third State</b></h4>
      <p>
        Once you're in Last State, add the following content, and then add the Interaction
        "End Conversation". It should end up looking like this:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state3End.png">
      <p>
        And that's it! You can always go back and add new States, refine your current ones,
        or check out any data you've gathered from learners.
      </p>
