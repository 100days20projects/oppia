        Welcome to the Oppia editor tutorial! This tutorial is meant to
        help you get started with your first exploration.
        First, we'll go over basic definitions and best practices, and then we'll
        walk through the process of making a small exploration.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="creating-an-exploration"></a>
      <h3><b>The Process of Creating an Exploration</b></h3>
      <p>
        Think of an exploration as a conversation with the learner. You might
        start by introducing the topic you want to explain/explore, and
        then try and get the learner to engage with it. Along the way, you can
        ask questions to help the learner check their understanding, and
        provide them with appropriate feedback so that they don't get
        frustrated.
      </p>
      <p><b>What should an exploration be about?</b></p>
      <p>
        Typically, an exploration revolves around a question -- usually, the
        more specific, the better. A few examples:

        <ul>
          <li>
            What is the slope of a line?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are the nutritional benefits of a banana?
          </li>
          <li>
            What is the difference between Python and C#?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the exploration does <em>not</em> need to go in depth or
        cover all aspects of what you are trying to teach. In fact, it's
        usually better and easier to make something basic (and non-branching)
        first, and then expand on it once learners start using the exploration.
        You'll be able to see the answers that learners are giving, and use
        these to add more states/feedback as needed.
      </p>

      <h3>The Exploration Editor</h3>

      <p>
        When you first create a new exploration, you'll be taken to its editor:
      </p>

      <img src="/images/tutorial/emptyExploration0.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">

      <p>
        The new exploration has just one State, called "First State". States
        are the building blocks of explorations. You can think of States as the
        places a learner (anybody who views your exploration) can potentially
        reach. All of your States are visible in the Exploration Overview on
        the right. The editor interface only shows one state at a time, but
        you can navigate to other States by clicking on them in the
        Exploration Overview.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="state-components"></a>
      <h3>Parts of a State</h3>

      <p>
        A State consists of some <b>content</b>, together with an
        <b>interaction</b> and some <b>rules</b> that can take the learner to
        another State depending on their answer. Here are the meanings of these
        terms:
      </p>
      <h4><b>Content</b></h4>
      <p>
        The editable block of text you see in the picture below. Write whatever
        you want the learner to read.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/content.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <h4><b>Interaction</b></h4>
      <p>
        This could be a text field or any kind of input field, such as a map.
        A learner will interact with these elements by entering some text or
        placing a marker on a map.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/interaction.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <h4><b>Rule</b></h4>
      <p>
        Once an interaction is chosen, you can choose what happens based on
        what the learner inputs. You can also provide feedback, and then either
        have the learner redo the interaction or move them to a different
        state.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/rule.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="sample-exploration"></a>
      <h3><b>Building a Sample Exploration</b></h3>
      <p>
        Now that you know what the terms mean, let's write a small exploration
        to help the learner understand the slope of a line!
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll create a total of 3 States for the learner to go through in a
        linear fashion. The user will start at the First State, answer a
        question to go to the Second State, and then answer another question to
        go to the Third State. Along the way, we'll add a few rules.
      </p>

      <h4><b>First State</b></h4>
      <p>
        Let's begin by writing our introduction and asking the learner a
        question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on the box under "First State" that you saw when the Exploration
        Editor first opened. That's the Content box. Type in the following:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/State1InitialContent.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        After saving the content, you'll be able to add an interaction. Let's
        add a number input interaction so the learner could input their answer
        to our question.
      </p>
      <p>Click on <b>Add Interaction</b>.</p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1AddInteraction.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>You'll be taken to a gallery from which you can choose an interaction
      to use. Go ahead and click on <b>Number Input</b>.</p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1NumberInput.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        Click on <b>Save Interaction</b>. The green box represents what the
        learner will see. They will be able to type their answer here.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1AfterNumberInput.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        Notice that you can now add Rules. We can now choose what happens if
        the learner types in "2", "3", or any other number. To keep it simple,
        let's just take the learner to the next state regardless of what they
        typed. The following shows how to do just that.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1Rule.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        Now this is important: the Destination section is where you will take
        the learner next. By default, it loops back to the current State,
        which means the learner will be re-asked to type in an answer to the
        same question (but, because it's still the same question, they won't be
        presented with the content again). However, let's set the Destination
        to a new State instead and call it "Method 2".
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1DestinationState.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        Click <b>Add State</b>, and then <b>Add New Rule</b>. You should see:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state1End.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        We're done with this state. The learner will proceed to the State
        "Method 2", so let's go there and explain the second method. We can do
        that by clicking on "Method 2" in the Destination link or in the
        Exploration Overview window. Once you do that, you'll be taken to the
        "Method 2" state.
      </p>

      <h4><b>Second State</b></h4>
      <p>
        Now we're in the second State, "Method 2". This looks just like what you
        started the exploration with, except that the title is different and
        the Exploration Overview shows two states.
      </p>
      <p>Add the following text:</p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state2Content.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        Add a <b>Number Input</b> Interaction just like in the First State.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's add two rules for the interaction, one if the learner types
        in an incorrect answer, and one if the answer is correct. Click on
        <b>Add Rule</b> and make sure it looks like the following:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state2Rule1.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        Notice that we didn't change the Destination. This means that, if the
        learner input falls into this category, the learner will see the
        feedback and will be asked again to type in a number.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'd also like to catch the case where the learner's answer is correct.
        Click <b>Add Rule</b> again, and this time change the rule to "Answer
        is equal to". Type '1', then add the following feedback and create a
        new Destination called "Last State". It should look like this:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/state2Rule2.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        After clicking <b>Add New Rule</b>, we'll be done with this state, so
        let's move to the "Last State" and conclude the exploration.
        (Alternatively, as an exercise, you could have a god at explaining the
        third slope method).
      </p>

      <h4><b>Third State</b></h4>
      <p>
        Once you're in "Last State", add the following content, and then add
        the "End Conversation" interaction:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/State3End.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        And, <em>voil√†</em> -- you've created your first exploration! Save the
        draft, and then give yourself a pat on the back.
      </p>

      <h3>Improving the Sample Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        After you've gotten some learners to play through your exploration, you
        can revisit it, look at the answers submitted, and improve the
        exploration based on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose you find that many learners give the answer 2 when
        faced with the second question. On asking some of them, you discover
        that they're computing (2 + 2)/(1 + 1). You can create an additional
        rule that reminds them of the slope equation and that helps them
        identify the various terms in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, you can always go back and add new States, refine the
        current ones, or check out answers that learners have submitted, so
        that you can improve the exploration further.
      </p>
      <h4><b>Example: Adding a Rule to our Sample Exploration</b></h4>
      <p>
        Let's say you create your sample exploration, and you know leaners are playing through it.
        To see the data captured by the exploration, let's go to the second State
        (Method 2) and see what answers learners have been trying
        (I submitted multiple random answers to demonstrate this).
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/unhandledAnswers.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        In general, these <b>Unhandled Answers</b> will be located at the bottom of each State
        and they can help you understand where students are messing up. For instance, suppose
        you notice that for the second question (asking learners to compute the slope between
        (1,1) and(2,2)), you're getting a response of -1. This could indicate that students
        are being inconsistent with the slope equation and incorrectly computing (y2-y1)/(x1-x2).
        This would give them -1. Let's make a rule to address this. When you finish saving the
        rule, it should look like this:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/tutorial/updateExplorationNewRule.png" class="oppia-long-text-image">
      <p>
        And that's it! You just updated your first exploration!
      </p>
