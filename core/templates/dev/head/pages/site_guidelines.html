                <h1>Using Oppia</h1>
                <p>
                  The main units of learning in Oppia are called explorations. These are multi-stage interactive activities that attempt to engage readers in a learning conversation and provide formative feedback along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any user of Oppia, logged-in or otherwise, can play through, browse, and search for any <a href="/learn">public explorations</a>. To create or edit explorations, a user will need to be logged-in and to author his/her work under a stable username.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Responses submitted to explorations are stored anonymously. The anonymized responses are shown to exploration creators and editors, so that the explorations can be improved over time.
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                    Ownership of explorations is temporary and eventually reverts to the Oppia community (see <a href="#lifecycle" target="_self">Lifecycle of an Exploration</a> for more details). The idea is to make it easy for the explorations on this site to improve continuously.
                  </li>
                  <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                    Cloning explorations in order to publish an alternative version is discouraged -- it is better to suggest improvements or give feedback on the original exploration. However, you are welcome to privately clone an exploration to see how it's made.
                  </li>
                  <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                    Please exercise judgement before publishing an exploration. Every exploration on this site should have significant educational value, and should not contain advertising, spam, vandalism or abuse.
                  </li>
                  <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                    Creating multiple usernames, using explorations to trick users, or circumventing site features that are meant to encourage the improvement of explorations are examples of antisocial behavior that may result in account suspension.
                  </li>
                  <li style="line-height: 25px;">

                    The governance model for Oppia comprises site admins and moderators. Site admins manage and have overall responsibility for the site; they are the final arbitrators on any dispute. Moderators suggest and review major edits for explorations, and enforce the behavioral norms described within these community guidelines.

                <h2 id="lifecycle">Lifecycle of an Exploration</h2>
                <p>
                  All explorations start off as private, which means that they can only be viewed by the exploration editors, invited playtesters, and site admins. When an exploration is in a good enough state for general use, any owner of the exploration may decide to publish it. Currently, publishing is a one-way process. After an exploration is published, it will enter "beta" status, and be visible in the public gallery to users who click "Show all explorations". Anyone will be able to play it, give feedback, and suggest edits. Owners are encouraged to submit high-quality explorations to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppia-moderator-requests">moderators' request forum</a>, and those that are approved will move out of beta status and become directly visible in the gallery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The editors of an exploration can retain exclusive editing rights as long as they continue to maintain the exploration and respond to feedback and change suggestions in a timely manner. Otherwise, the exploration will be considered 'orphaned' and ownership of it will revert to the community, who will then be able to collectively improve the exploration over time. The owner(s) of an exploration may also choose to release ownership to the community at any time.

                <h1>Exploration publishing criteria</h1>
                <p>
                  In order to ensure that Oppia is filled with high-quality explorations that do a good job of helping people learn something new, there are some minimal criteria for publishing an exploration to the "beta" stage and later moving it to the "released" stage. These are described below:
                </p>

                <h2>"Beta" criteria</h2>
                <p>
                  The following criteria for publishing an exploration to "beta" stage are meant to ensure that playtesters can test beta explorations meaningfully and leave helpful feedback, and that it is possible to continue developing and refining these explorations to move towards the Released stage. These criteria are intended to be objective and precise, so that it is easy for anyone to determine whether a particular exploration fits the criteria.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>It teaches something.</strong> The exploration should present information that is new to the target audience, and not just test knowledge that its target audience is already assumed to have.
                    </li>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>It teaches more than a single factoid.</strong> The information presented should be either "deep" - an involved and tricky concept that has nuances and depth to it, or "broad" - a collection of related interesting facts that the learner can understand and remember better after playing through the exploration.
                    </li>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>It provides informative feedback.</strong> The feedback that it provides to the players should be more than just "Correct" or "Incorrect"; it should provide (or guide players toward) the reasoning about why something is right or wrong, and how to correct it if necessary. An exploration should be more than just a quiz!
                    </li>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>It doesn't duplicate an existing Beta or Released exploration</strong>. It's fine to teach the same thing using a significantly different way of teaching, but if a new exploration teaches the exact same things as an existing one, in the same way, then the effort would be better spent submitting feedback to, and improving, the existing one.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>"Released" criteria</h2>
                <p>
                  The criteria for releasing an exploration are meant to ensure that the explorations in the Learn gallery are educational, interesting to our learners, and make appropriate use of the interactive, discovery-based learning style that the Oppia tool enables. The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/oppia/wiki/DesignTips">Design Tips</a> wiki page has some constructive advice on how to create explorations that fit these criteria, especially how to design useful, formative feedback.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>Understanding, not memorization.</strong> Does the exploration attempt to teach some interesting concept, or does it merely provide facts for the student to memorize?
                    </li>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>Learning, not assessment.</strong> Does the exploration present new concepts to the learners, or does it simply quiz them on some set of topics? (Even if a quiz later gives out the right answers, this does not necessarily help a learner master the new concepts effectively.)
                    </li>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>Learn by doing.</strong> How is the new information presented to the learner? Does he have a chance to reason about the concepts himself, try out using them, and receive feedback on what he did?
                    </li>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>Formative feedback.</strong> Does the feedback that you provide to the learner give him new useful insights into the problem? Does it find a good middle ground between simply telling the user he's wrong (or right), and giving the entire answer away? Do the feedback rules cover a wide range of possible answers and misconceptions? Is there a catch-all default rule that nevertheless tries to guide the learner toward a good solution?
                    </li>
                    <li style="line-height: 25px;">
                      <strong>Complete and polished.</strong> Is the exploration free of typos, factual errors and bugs? Is the text well-written and easy to read? Does the exploration deliver all the content it has promised to the learner, either within the exploration or as stated the learning objective?
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
