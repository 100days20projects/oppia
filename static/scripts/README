TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

This folder contains embedding scripts for Oppia explorations, and tests for
them. Currently, the tests need to be done manually. They should be run as
follows:

- Load the 'Welcome' demo exploration (with id '0') on a local development
  server.
- Change the content of the initial state to anything you like. This changes
  the exploration to version 2.
- In a browser window, open each of the HTML files in this folder, and ensure
  that they do the correct thing.

The features supported in each version of the embedding script are as follows:

- v0.0.0: simple embedding; embedding a particular version of an exploration
- v0.0.1: simple embedding; embedding a particular version of an exploration;
    embedding with delayed loading and a 'load' button


TODO(sll): Write automated integration tests that load the HTML pages and check
that the relevant embedding assertions are satisfied.
