          Please be aware that Oppia is being developed actively, and that the
          <a href="http://oppia-test-server.appspot.com/">Oppia test server</a>
          can go down at any time. In addition, content on the test server site
          may be deleted without notice until Oppia moves into beta (non-preview)
          mode. We suggest that, in the meantime, you take backups of your explorations
          by downloading a YAML file from the exploration editor page, and
          keeping a copy of any images that you upload to the server. (We are hoping
          to get into a more stable state soon.)
